I love dogs

My topic is about Dog breeds and their rankings.

Say you want a dog but you're not sure what to get. You want specific ones, small breeds, big breeds, ones that are long hair, short hair because you are allergic and your kid wants one or even a prize winner for doggie super bowl. 

Well look no further you have a doggie database. 

I found my data from data.world. 
One was dog breeds, with heigh, weight, life span and another with rankings by years between 2013 and 2016. You want a popular dog this is the database for you. 

I cleaned up and merded it via taking out dups and nan. I also took made sure all numbers were rounded by .0 decilmal. 

I also concluded an average throughout 2013-2016 data ranking. Just in case a precious dog apparantly didnt do well one year (which is outrageous cause all dogs are amazing). 

You can run a querie for any lifespan(everyone wants a dog to outlive them), weight, height, most popular. Its up to you.
